# Copilot Instructions

## Language
- Use English for all repository content (code, docs, comments, issues, PRs, and commit messages).

## Commands and automation
- Document all commands in /Justfile.
- Do not force scripts into the Justfile. If a script is needed, place it under scripts/ and call it from the Justfile if appropriate.

## GitHub responsibility
- The agent is responsible for GitHub operations up to and including push (not just commit).
